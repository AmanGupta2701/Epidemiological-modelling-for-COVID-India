# Epidemiological-modelling-for-COVID-India

Project aims to explain epidemiological modelling and the various models
available for modelling different infectious diseases and give example of the
spread of COVID-19 pandemic in India.
An epidemiological modeling is a simplified means of describing the
transmission of communicable disease through individuals. These simplest
models are formulated as initial value problems for system of ordinary
differential equations are formulated mathematically.

Model used to analyze COVID-19 situation is SEIR. In this model the
population is divided into the following classes:
S(Susceptible)->E(Exposed)->R(Recovered)->D(Dead)
(total population) N = S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + R(t)
